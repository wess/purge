# purge (prg)

<p align="center">
  <strong>purge</strong> (<code>prg</code>) is a simple, AppZapper‑style command‑line uninstaller for macOS applications.
</p>

## 📜 Overview

`prg` automates removal of an app bundle and all its associated files—preferences, caches, support files, receipts, and more—by parsing the app’s metadata and scanning known system directories. Think of it as a drag‑and‑drop uninstaller in your terminal.

## 🚀 Features

* **Bundle metadata parsing**: Extracts `CFBundleIdentifier` and `CFBundleName` from the app’s `Info.plist`.
* **Targeted scan paths**: Searches only standard macOS locations (`~/Library/Preferences`, `~/Library/Caches`, `/var/db/receipts`, etc.) for speed and accuracy.
* **Interactive selection**: Presents an interactive checklist so you can choose which files to keep or delete.
* **Dry‑run support**: Preview all candidate files without actually trashing them (coming soon!).
* **Single‑file binary**: Delivered as a self‑contained executable via `bun build --compile`, no Bun runtime required on target machines.
